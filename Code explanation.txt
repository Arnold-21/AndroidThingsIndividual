 - Firstly the program will read the sound analog values from the soundPin variable, in this case the A0 pin
 - Than reads the analog ouptut of the light sensor the same way, in this case it is the A2 pin

 - The values have been reached via trial and error, while calibrating the sound module's sensitivity and while checking the ouptu values of the light sensor
 - In the case of the sound module, the sensitivity was configured, by turning the the controller anti-clock-wise to make more sensitive.
 - Both outputs during testing have been printed to the Serial monitor, for readability

 - If the if statement passes, meaning a sound has been made, bigger than the treshold, like a slight clap, something falling or something similar and it's nighttime
	the rgb will turn on with a red light
 - Otherwise the rgb is turned off, meaning no current through the pins
